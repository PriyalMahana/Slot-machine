Slot Machine Game – Project Report

1. Introduction

This project is a simple Slot Machine game implemented in Python. It
demonstrates the use of loops, functions, random number generation,
conditional logic, and user interaction in console-based programs.

2. Problem Statement

The objective is to design a program that simulates a Slot Machine. The
game should allow the user to deposit money, place bets, spin the slot,
and calculate winnings based on matching symbols.

3. Objectives

-   To understand basic Python programming.
-   To implement game logic using functions.
-   To work with random number generation.
-   To enhance logical thinking by creating a real-world game
    simulation.

4. Methodology

1.  The user deposits money.
2.  The game asks the player how many lines they want to bet on.
3.  Symbols are randomly generated using Python’s random module.
4.  Winnings are calculated based on matched symbols.
5.  The game continues until the balance becomes zero or the user quits.

5. Code Explanation

The code uses: - random.choice() to pick symbols. - Functions to
separate logic: - deposit() - get_bet() - spin_slot_machine() -
check_winnings() - Loops for continuous gameplay.

6. Sample Output

Example:

    --- Spinning ---
    🔔 | 🌸 | 🔔
    🌸 | 🔔 | 🌸
    ✨ | ✨ | ✨   ← WIN! 

    You won ₹50!
    Current balance: ₹120

7. Conclusion

This project helped understand Python’s core concepts, including loops,
functions, and randomization while developing a small but fun console
game.
